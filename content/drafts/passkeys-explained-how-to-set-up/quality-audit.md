# Quality audit: Google Passkeys Tutorial | Step by Step Guide to Set Up Google Passkeys

## Editorial review

Tick each item only after checking it against the draft. Leave a one-line note on anything borderline.
`audit-draft.mjs --finalize` refuses to mark the draft DRAFT while any box below is unticked.

### Originality
- [x] This is substantially more than a rewritten transcript: the structure, examples and explanations are my own
- [x] Independent research contributed information the video does not contain (see research.md §6)
- [x] The article stands alone; a reader never needs to watch the video
- [x] The creator's phrasing and style are not imitated; any quote is short and attributed

### Accuracy
- [x] Every important factual claim is VERIFIED or CORRECTED in the claims ledger
- [x] Anything time-sensitive (prices, versions, limits, rules) was checked against a current source and dated ("as of …")
- [x] Statistics link to the original source, not a blog repeating them
- [x] Unverifiable points were cut or stated with clear uncertainty

### Usefulness
- [x] The reader leaves able to do or decide something
- [x] At least one concrete worked example (numbers, a real config, a realistic scenario)
- [x] Hard concepts are explained in plain language before jargon is used
- [x] Every section answers a real reader question; no filler sections

### SEO
- [x] Title and H1 match what someone would search, and read naturally
- [x] Heading hierarchy is logical (one H1, H2 sections, H3 only under H2)
- [x] Keywords appear where they fit naturally; no stuffing
- [x] FAQ questions are ones people actually ask, and answers aren't repeats of the body

### Readability
- [x] Short paragraphs, varied sentence length, simple words
- [x] Lists and tables used only where they help
- [x] No stock AI phrasing (checked by the script) and no "X isn't Y — it's Z" habit

### Visuals
- [x] Each screenshot shows what its caption says, with no cookie banners, logins or personal data
- [x] Every image has descriptive alt text and a caption
- [x] Images sit next to the step or idea they illustrate

### Trust
- [x] No invented personal experience, tests, or anecdotes
- [x] Every source in sources.md was actually opened; no invented citations
- [x] Opinions are labeled as opinions and attributed

### Monetization safety
- [x] Not thin, not a transcript republish, not a listicle of well-known things
- [x] No misleading claims, clickbait title, or spammy SEO patterns

## Issues found and fixes made

- The newest video reports August 2026 Black Hat research; the Google part was verified with 9to5Google and is presented with its key precondition (malware already on the PC). The SpecterOps/Entra findings weren't independently checked and aren't detailed in the article.
- Two setup videos are ~3 years old; current requirements and menu names come from Google's help page.
- The services list is phrased as examples; support changes often.
- No images: account security pages are personal.

## Open items for the human reviewer

Things only the author can do: add a real first-hand observation where marked `<!-- AUTHOR: … -->`, confirm the category, decide on any borderline claim.

- AUTHOR note after the setup steps.
- Check for any Google update on the Pass-ta-key findings before publishing.
